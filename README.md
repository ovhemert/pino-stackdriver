You should install `pino-stackdriver` globally for ease of use:

```bash

```

## Requirements

This package internally uses the Google cloud logging library to call the Stackdriver Logging API. To be able to log to Stackdriver, some setup is needed on the Google Cloud platform.

Create a service account on the page [Stackdriver Logging Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/libraries). This downloads a JSON file with the credentials required.
